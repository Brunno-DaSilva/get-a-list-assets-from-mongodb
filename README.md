## Overview: üëª

This script retrieves a list of assets from a MongoDB database and generates a TypeScript file containing the data array. The data array is named `ASSETS_FROM_MONGO`. This script allows specifying the number of records to retrieve and the number of records to skip in the MongoDB query.

## Script Breakdown ‚úçüèΩ

This script connects to a MongoDB database, retrieves a list of assets based on specified criteria, and exports the data as a TypeScript array.

1. **Imports and Constants:**

   - The script imports necessary modules and types from external files.
   - It imports `MongoClient` and `Db` from MongoDB to establish a connection.
   - Constant values like `ENV_NAME`, `MONGO_CONNECTION_STRING`, and others are imported from `constants.ts`.
   - Logger-related functions such as `setLogFile`, `writeError`, and `writeDataAsIs` are imported from `logger/logger.ts`.

2. **Command and Description:**

   - `command` and `desc` variables provide a brief description of the script's purpose.

3. **Database Initialization:**

   - The script initializes a MongoDB database named `events_db`.

4. **Command Builder:**

   - The `builder` function defines command line options using `yargs`.

5. **Main Handler Function:**

   - The `handler` function is the main entry point of the script.
   - It sets up logging configurations based on the environment.
   - It connects to the MongoDB database using the provided connection string.
   - Retrieves a list of assets based on specified criteria using the `getListOfAssets` function.
   - Converts the retrieved assets into a string format and writes them to a TypeScript file named `assets-array.ts`.
   - Handles errors and exits the process with status code 0.

6. **Function to Retrieve Assets:**
   - The `getListOfAssets` function queries the MongoDB collection named `denorm_vendor_asset_records`.
   - It applies aggregation pipeline stages to filter and project the desired fields.
   - The function returns an array of assets, converted to the `Asset` type.

This script provides a flexible way to retrieve assets from MongoDB and export them into a TypeScript file for further processing or analysis.

## Technologies Used üöÄ

The project utilizes various technologies to achieve its functionality and meet its requirements. These technologies include:

- **MongoDB**: MongoDB is a NoSQL database management system that uses a document-oriented data model. It offers flexibility and scalability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

- **TypeScript (TS)**: TypeScript is an open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a superset of JavaScript that adds optional static typing and other features to the language. TypeScript helps improve code quality and maintainability, especially in large-scale projects.

- **moment.js**: moment.js is a JavaScript library for parsing, validating, manipulating, and formatting dates and times. It provides a robust set of functions for working with dates and times, making it easier to handle complex date-related operations in JavaScript applications.

- **fs (File System)**: The fs module is part of Node.js and provides filesystem-related functionality. It allows Node.js applications to interact with the filesystem, including reading and writing files, creating directories, and more.

- **lodash**: lodash is a JavaScript utility library that provides functions for common programming tasks. It offers a wide range of functions for working with arrays, objects, numbers, and strings. The forEach function, for example, is part of the lodash library and is used for iterating over arrays and objects efficiently.

These technologies work together to support the project's requirements and enable the development of robust and scalable software solutions.
